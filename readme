What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

I thought that this assignment was helpful for better understanding the 
string functions in the standard C library and that implementing them 
two different ways, using array and pointer notation, was useful for 
getting me to think about different ways to access elements. I also 
found it quite fun to implement both a module and then a client that 
uses the module, as it was cool to see the programs being applied.

Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

No, it is not possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify 
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large enough 
because pointers in C don't store any information about the memory sizes
allocated for them. Thus, the caller has the responsibility to ensure that 
there is enough space.
